## All updates to files will be highlighted here.

### 0-positive_or_negative.c:

- <time.h> imports the function (time) which holds digits it miliseconds.
- <stdio.h> imports putchar function.
- <stdlib.h> declares function for character conversion and storage allocation. 
- srand function seeds milliseconds generated  by rand() function.
- RAND_MAX: environment variable for random function.

### 1-last_digit.c: 

- n % 10 ==> divides the generated value by 10 to get the remainder, through the modulus %

### 2-print_alphabet.c:
- the first alphabet is declared and assigned a variable.
- while the assigned variable is less or equal to the last letter z, put a character (putchar)
  then increase the value by one character.

### 3-print_alphabets.c:

- for the assigned variable, print the lowercase alphabets from a-z, followed by uppercase 
  alphabets from A-B. Return 0 value for code success.

### 4-print_alphabt.c:

- for the assigned variable, print the lowercase alphabets from a-z, excluding q and e through
  the (if) conditional statement.

### 5-print_numbers.c:

- base 10 numbers counts from 0 to 10.
- using printf, a format specifier %i used in printing formated output for integers.

### 6-print_numberz.c:

- by default, putchar is used in displaying single characters.
  We convert integers to characters inside putchar() function by adding '0'.

### 7-print_tebahpla.c:

- for the assigned variable, print the lowercase alphabets from z-a; in the reversed order.

### 8-print_base16.c:

- base 16 numbers counts from 10 to 15. For this case, we've concatenated the alphabets a-f 
  to produce alphanumeric base 16 results.

### 9-print_comb.c:

- the program prints all possible single-unit combinations, separated by a comma.
- use (',') or ASCII(44) to separate the output
- use ( ) or ASCII(32) to insert space after digit.
* Note: this applies best in putchar function where printf is restricted for use. 

### 100-print_comb3.c:

### 101-print_comb4.c:

### 102-print_comb5.c:
