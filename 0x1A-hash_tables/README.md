## C - Hash tables

- djb2: This function generates hash values for strings.
It takes a string as input, represented by the str parameter. The string is expected to be an array of unsigned characters. The function initializes a variable hash to the initial value of 5381. This value is an arbitrary starting point for the hash calculation. The function iterates through each character of the input string using a while loop and assigns it to the variable c.
